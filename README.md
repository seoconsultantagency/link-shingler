A link shingler refers to a technique used primarily in information retrieval and web search engines to detect and compare the similarity between different documents or webpages. The method is particularly effective for detecting near-duplicate content across large datasets.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Shingling: A document or webpage is divided into overlapping sequences of words or characters, which are called "shingles." For example, for a sentence "the cat sat on the mat," a shingle of length 3 could be "the cat sat," "cat sat on," "sat on the," and so on.

Hashing: Each shingle is then hashed into a number, creating a set of hashes that represent the document.

Comparison: The sets of hashed shingles from different documents are compared. If two documents share a significant number of the same hashed shingles, they are considered similar or near-duplicates.

Link shinglers specifically focus on the links (URLs) present within a webpage rather than the text content. The technique involves creating shingles out of the outgoing links in a webpage and then comparing these to other pages to find similarities. This can be useful for identifying duplicate or near-duplicate pages where the content is similar mainly because they share the same or a similar set of links.

The concept is widely used in web crawling and indexing to ensure that search engines do not waste resources indexing identical or near-identical pages and to improve the quality of search results by reducing redundancy.
